# Interactive robot with Neural Networks

This repository provides a Python implementation in Keras and Tensorflow of the [Matching Networks for One Shot Learning](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6385-matching-networks-for-one-shot-learning.pdf) paper and transfer learning in an interactive robot scenario using [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic).

This project is part of the Master's Thesis project for the MLT programme at the University of Gothenburg.
